    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <P>Hi, my name is Jeremiah Sprague.
         Today I learned that there are a lot of cool people that
          want to learn how to code and are teachers. I learned how 
          to use github, how to use the command function, visual studio 
code, and a lesson in Murphy's Law when my computer decided to update and 
took at least an hour and a half!</P>
